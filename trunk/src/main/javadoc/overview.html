</head>

<body>
Java Domain Object Templater (JDot) is a code generator which keeps domain classes concise like a dot. 
The generation is driven by annotations on your domain classes or interfaces and uses the compile-time Java 6 Annotation Processor.

Generated code:
<ul>
<li>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with Java Bean getters and setters
<li>Builders for immutable domain objects
<li>Mappers between domain and DTO classes
<li>Standard java.lang.Object methods hashCode and equals for configurable fields
</ul>

The code generation may be driven by:
<ul>
<li>Interface implemented by domain class and DTO
<li>Abstract domain class
</ul>
